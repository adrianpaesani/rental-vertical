- Create a product and mark it as rentable by setting rental = True.
- Go to page 'Rental Price'.
- Activate the required boolean fields for hourly, daily or monthly rental.
- Save the product.
- Add a usual price for one hour, one day or one month.
- Add bulk prices, e.g. one day costs 300 €, 7 days 290 €, 21 days 250 €, and so on.

Hint: The bulk prices are added in the product form view of the stockable, rentable product 
but are actually used for its related rental service!
