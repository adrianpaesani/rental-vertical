Rental Invoice

Description
-----------

This module add the 2-phase confirmation of incoming invoices including delegated charging to customers.

The accountant or purchaser has to confirm both the successful factual check, 
i.e. the company expected to get this invoice, and the successful 
arithmetical check, i.e. the product quantities, prices, accounts and taxes are correct.
If this incoming invoice should be invoiced to a customer, an outgoing invoice can be 
created directly from the vendor bill and will have the same invoice lines.
