The off-days can only be used for products rentable in days.

- Create a stockable product and activate that it is rentable in days.
- Adjust its stock in location 'Rental In'.
- Create a sale order and rent out the product in days.
- Set a start and end date, e.g. for 3 weeks.
- On sale order line you will see a page 'Off-Days'.
- Choose the type 'Weekend' in order to create 'Fixed Off-Days' and you get a list with all saturdays
  and sundays within the rental period.
- Add some additional off-days.
- The number of off-days reduces the rental quantity and is therefore not included in price calculation.
